Making high quality stacks requires having enough graphene, graphite, and hBN flakes.
This sub-repository documents graphite and hBN density on the taping stages and records how many "good" flakes were found.

A good graphene flake is:
- at least 15 x 15 um

A good graphite flake is:
- at least 20x20 um (must be bigger than graphene)

A good hBN flake
- at least 20 x 20 um (must be bigger than graphite & graphene)
- for the bottom hBN, ~30-40nm in thickness
- for the top hBN, ~20nm in thickness.

All flakes are:
- no folds
- no cracks
- uniorm thickness throughout the flake
