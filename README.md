**Grapheneâ€“hBN Heterostructure Fabrication**

**Author:** Davyd Kasperovych-Pustovit

**Affiliation**: Quantum Materials and Devices Lab, Duke University

**Overview**

This repository documents the fabrication and optimization of van der Waals heterostructures composed of graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and graphite. These stacks form the basis for quantum transport devices used to study coherent electron behavior and correlated states in two-dimensional materials.

The current focus is on developing reproducible stacking techniques for three-layer (hBNâ€“grapheneâ€“hBN) and four-layer (graphiteâ€“hBNâ€“grapheneâ€“hBN) structures. The goal is to establish a reliable fabrication pipeline with high yield and clean interfaces suitable for low-temperature quantum measurements.

**Results**

Operational Stacks: 2 (one three-layer, one four-layer)

Goal: 20 reproducible stacks by end of 2025

**Future Work**

Increase exfoliation yield through improved tape selection and substrate preparation.

Incorporate AFM and Raman analysis for flake verification.

Integrate completed stacks into superconducting device fabrication.

Automate photo documentation and parameter logging for process analysis.

**Author Notes**

This project is part of my ongoing research in experimental condensed matter physics and quantum device fabrication. The repository will be updated as the stacking process is refined and as additional stacks are fabricated and characterized.
