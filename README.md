Project Description: Quantum materials research is driving the development of next-generation electronic and computing technologies, where control of materials at the atomic level determines device performance. Graphene and related two-dimensional materials offer an exceptional platform for studying quantum phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect and superconductivity. In the Finkelstein Lab, we fabricate and refine multilayer heterostructures composed of graphene, graphite, and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to enable high-precision quantum transport experiments.

The project centers on developing reliable, repeatable fabrication techniques for assembling high-quality graphene-based devices. This includes exfoliating thin flakes, identifying layers of appropriate thickness, and stacking them via polymer-assisted dry transfer methods. Each stage requires experimental precision, iterative optimization, and a deep understanding of the subtle factors that influence final device quality. The resulting heterostructures—such as graphene encapsulated between hBN with a graphite back gate—will be used in cryogenic measurements by researchers in the group.

Future directions involve custom AFM etching of graphite back gates, Raman spectroscopy for structural characterization, and exploration of new geometries such as twisted or rhombohedral graphene layers. Through this work, the project aims to establish a reliable fabrication pipeline that will accelerate discovery of emergent quantum phenomena in two-dimensional materials.

Work Being Done: Students will gain hands-on experience in the fabrication and optimization of two-dimensional material stacks. Work involves cleanroom-based sample preparation, optical inspection of flakes, and refinement of process parameters to improve device quality and reproducibility. As skills develop, students may assist with AFM or Raman characterization and collaborate with graduate researchers on integrating devices for low-temperature studies.
